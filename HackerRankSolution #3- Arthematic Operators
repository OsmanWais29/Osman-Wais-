6

SOLUTION

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    
    
sum_ab= a + b
diff_ab= a - b
prod_ab= a * b

print(sum_ab)
print(diff_ab)
print(prod_ab)


Analysis 

sum_ab = a + b: Calculates the sum of a and b and stores the result in sum_ab.
diff_ab = a - b: Calculates the difference of a and b and stores the result in diff_ab.
prod_ab = a * b: Calculates the product of a and b and stores the result in prod_ab.

print(sum_ab): Prints the value of sum_ab to the console.
print(diff_ab): Prints the value of diff_ab to the console.
print(prod_ab): Prints the value of prod_ab to the console.
