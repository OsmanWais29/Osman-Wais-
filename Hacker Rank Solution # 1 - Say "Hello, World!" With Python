**Question #1 - Say "Hello, World!" With Python**

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

print("Hello, World!")
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
The above code will print Hello, World! on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor below!

Input Format

You do not need to read any input in this challenge.

Output Format

Print Hello, World! to stdout.


**SOLUTION**


GOMD= "Hello, World!"
print(GOMD)


**ANALYSIS**

1. String Assignment:
In Python, strings are used for representing textual data. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes (“”). 
I had created a string object and assigned it to the variable GOMD. In any case you can assign it to whatever you want, for personal enjoyment I chose 
GOMD.


2. Variable Usage:
I used a variable (GOMD) to store the string "Hello, World!".
Variables act as placeholders for data in Python.


3. print() Function:
I  employed the print() function to display the contents of the GOMD variable to the console.

The print() function is a built-in Python function for outputting values.

Overall:
The code accurately fulfills the task of printing "Hello, World!" to the console using a variable to store the string. It demonstrates a basic understanding of string handling, variable assignment, and the print() function in Python.
